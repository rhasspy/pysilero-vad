"""Setup for pysilero-vad.

This file is kept for backward compatibility with tools that expect it.
The actual build is now handled by CMake via scikit-build-core.
All configuration is in pyproject.toml and CMakeLists.txt.
"""

# With scikit-build-core, setup.py can be empty or minimal.
# The build backend specified in pyproject.toml handles everything.
